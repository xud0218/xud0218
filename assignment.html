            <h3>Assignment 2: KMeans Clustering Visualization Webpage</h3>
            <p>Develop an interactive web application that demonstrates the KMeans clustering algorithm using various initialization methods. This project allows you to explore the impact of different initialization strategies on the clustering outcome</p>

            <h3>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition</h3>
            <p>In this assignment you will need to implement the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from scratch. You will also need to use the SVD to perform dimensionality reduction on a dataset, explore the effect of the number of dimensions on the performance of a classifier, and visualize your results for comparison and analysis.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 4: Latent Semantic Analysis</h3>
            <p>In this assignment, you will develop an interactive web application that implements a basic search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The search engine will take a user’s query, perform LSA on a pool of documents, and return the top documents based on cosine similarity.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 5: K-Nearest Neighbors</h3>
            <p>In this assignment, you will develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., leave the bank) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Customer churn is a significant problem in the banking industry, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, banks can take proactive steps to improve customer retention.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 6: Linear Regression</h3>
            <p>In this assignment, you'll explore the impact of changing parameters on linear regression. The goal is to create an interactive webpage to demonstrate how modifying these parameters affects regression results, especially when there is no actual relationship between X and Y.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 7: Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Linear Regression</h3>
            <p>In this assignment, you’ll extend your previous work from Assignment 6 to include hypothesis testing and confidence intervals through simulations. You’ll enhance your interactive webpage to allow users to perform hypothesis tests on the slope or intercept of the regression line and generate confidence intervals based on simulations.</p>
